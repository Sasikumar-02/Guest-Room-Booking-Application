# Guest Room Booking Application

The Guest Room Booking Application is a web-based portal that allows users to search and book rooms in various guest houses or hotels. The application provides a seamless experience for both clients and administrators.

## Project Overview

The Guest Room Booking Application serves as a platform where clients can easily search for available rooms and make bookings, while administrators have access to manage users, guest houses, and room listings. The application leverages modern web technologies such as MongoDB, Express, Node.js for the backend, and React.js for the frontend.

## Features

- User Authentication: The application supports user authentication, allowing clients to create accounts and login securely. Administrators have additional privileges to manage user accounts.

- Search and Filtering: Clients can search for available rooms based on their preferred location, dates, and other search criteria. The application provides filtering options to refine search results.

- Room Listings: Administrators can manage room listings, including adding new rooms, updating existing rooms, and removing rooms from the system. Each room listing contains detailed information about the room, such as photos, amenities, pricing, and availability.

- Booking Process: Clients can select a room and proceed to book it for their desired dates. The application handles the booking process, ensuring that the room is reserved for the specified duration and updating availability accordingly.

- User Dashboard: Clients have access to a user dashboard where they can view their bookings, manage their account settings, and track their booking history.

- Administrator Dashboard: Administrators have a dedicated dashboard to manage users, view bookings, and update guest house details. They can perform administrative tasks such as adding new users, approving bookings, and modifying guest house information.

## Technologies Used
